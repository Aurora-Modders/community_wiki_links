# Aurora Community Wiki Links

This mod's very simple - it adds links to relevant Aurora Community Wiki pages in various textboxes within Aurora.

At the moment, this mod only impacts:

* The description of certain project types in the Create Research Project window
* The description of certain technologies in the Research tab of the Economics window
* (optionally) The names of ground combat components, as displayed in the ground unit details window
