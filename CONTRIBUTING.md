# Technical contributions

If you're technically inclined (i.e. comfortable working with SQL, C#, and/or other programming languages) and want to contribute to this mod, all you have to do is open up a pull request against [this repository](https://github.com/thashepherd/community_wiki_links)! We're particularly interested in getting the right information out in front of both new and veteran Aurora Players.

# Community contributions

If you want to help out the Aurora community but aren't comfortable diving into code, you can still help - all you need to do is edit or add content to the [Aurora Community Wiki](http://aurorawiki.pentarch.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)!
